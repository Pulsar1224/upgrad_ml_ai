      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\r\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\r\n",

      "bats eat cats?â for, you see, as she couldnât answer either question,\r\n",

      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\r\n",

      "get out again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\r\n",

      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\r\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\r\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\r\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\r\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\r\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\r\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\r\n",
      "into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\r\n",
      "that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\r\n",
      "those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\r\n",
      "doorway; âand even if my head would go through,â thought poor Alice, âit\r\n",
      "would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could\r\n",
      "shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.â\r\n",
      "For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\r\n",

      "impossible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "see whether itâs marked âpoisonâ or notâ; for she had read several nice\r\n",
      "little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\r\n",
      "beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\r\n",

      "growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\r\n",

      "âA knot!â said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\r\n",
      "anxiously about her. âOh, do let me help to undo it!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI shall do nothing of the sort,â said the Mouse, getting up and walking\r\n",

      "âI didnât mean it!â pleaded poor Alice. âBut youâre so easily offended,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âPlease come back and finish your story!â Alice called after it; and the\r\n",
      "others all joined in chorus, âYes, please do!â but the Mouse only shook\r\n",
      "its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat a pity it wouldnât stay!â sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite\r\n",
      "out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her\r\n",
      "daughter âAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\r\n",
      "YOUR temper!â âHold your tongue, Ma!â said the young Crab, a little\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!â said Alice aloud, addressing\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?â said the\r\n",
      "Lory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\r\n",
      "âDinahâs our cat. And sheâs such a capital one for catching mice you\r\n",
      "canât think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\r\n",
      "sheâll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\r\n",
      "birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\r\n",
      "carefully, remarking, âI really must be getting home; the night-air\r\n",
      "doesnât suit my throat!â and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to\r\n",
      "its children, âCome away, my dears! Itâs high time you were all in bed!â\r\n",
      "On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI wish I hadnât mentioned Dinah!â she said to herself in a melancholy\r\n",
      "tone. âNobody seems to like her, down here, and Iâm sure sheâs the best\r\n",
      "cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\r\n",
      "any more!â And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\r\n",
      "lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard\r\n",
      "a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\r\n",

      "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\r\n",
      "anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\r\n",
      "it muttering to itself âThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\r\n",
      "my fur and whiskers! Sheâll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\r\n",
      "ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?â Alice guessed in a\r\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,\r\n",
      "and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\r\n",
      "nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in\r\n",

      "out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!\r\n",
      "Quick, now!â And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once\r\n",
      "in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it\r\n",
      "had made.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHe took me for his housemaid,â she said to herself as she ran. âHow\r\n",
      "surprised heâll be when he finds out who I am! But Iâd better take him\r\n",
      "his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.â As she said this, she\r\n",

      "plate with the name âW. RABBITâ engraved upon it. She went in without\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âHow queer it seems,â Alice said to herself, âto be going messages for\r\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinahâll be sending me on messages next!â And she\r\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: ââMiss Alice! Come\r\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!â âComing in a minute,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\r\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs\r\n",
      "of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,\r\n",
      "and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little\r\n",
      "bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time\r\n",
      "with the words âDRINK ME,â but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it\r\n",
      "to her lips. âI know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,â she said\r\n",
      "to herself, âwhenever I eat or drink anything; so Iâll just see what\r\n",
      "this bottle does. I do hope itâll make me grow large again, for really\r\n",
      "Iâm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\r\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\r\n",

      "grow any more--As it is, I canât get out at the door--I do wish I hadnât\r\n",
      "drunk quite so much!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\r\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\r\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\r\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\r\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\r\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself âNow I\r\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\r\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\r\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\r\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt was much pleasanter at home,â thought poor Alice, âwhen one wasnât\r\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\r\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadnât gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and\r\n",
      "yet--itâs rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\r\n",
      "CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that\r\n",
      "kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!\r\n",
      "There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I\r\n",
      "grow up, Iâll write one--but Iâm grown up now,â she added in a sorrowful\r\n",
      "tone; âat least thereâs no room to grow up any more HERE.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut then,â thought Alice, âshall I NEVER get any older than I am\r\n",
      "now? Thatâll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but\r\n",
      "then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnât like THAT!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, you foolish Alice!â she answered herself. âHow can you learn\r\n",

      "for any lesson-books!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making\r\n",
      "quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard\r\n",
      "a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMary Ann! Mary Ann!â said the voice. âFetch me my gloves this moment!â\r\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\r\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\r\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\r\n",
      "as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\r\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and Aliceâs elbow was pressed hard against it,\r\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself âThen Iâll\r\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTHAT you wonâtâ thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\r\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\r\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\r\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\r\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\r\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next came an angry voice--the Rabbitâs--âPat! Pat! Where are you?â And\r\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, âSure then Iâm here! Digging\r\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDigging for apples, indeed!â said the Rabbit angrily. âHere! Come and\r\n",
      "help me out of THIS!â (Sounds of more broken glass.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNow tell me, Pat, whatâs that in the window?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSure, itâs an arm, yer honour!â (He pronounced it âarrum.â)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\r\n",
      "window!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSure, it does, yer honour: but itâs an arm for all that.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, itâs got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\r\n",
      "now and then; such as, âSure, I donât like it, yer honour, at all, at\r\n",
      "all!â âDo as I tell you, you coward!â and at last she spread out her\r\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\r\n",
      "TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. âWhat a number of\r\n",
      "cucumber-frames there must be!â thought Alice. âI wonder what theyâll do\r\n",
      "next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! Iâm\r\n",
      "sure I donât want to stay in here any longer!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\r\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\r\n",
      "all talking together: she made out the words: âWhereâs the other\r\n",
      "ladder?--Why, I hadnât to bring but one; Billâs got the other--Bill!\r\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!--Here, put âem up at this corner--No, tie âem\r\n",
      "together first--they donât reach half high enough yet--Oh! theyâll\r\n",
      "do well enough; donât be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this\r\n",
      "rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, itâs coming\r\n",
      "down! Heads below!â (a loud crash)--âNow, who did that?--It was Bill, I\r\n",
      "fancy--Whoâs to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shanât! YOU do it!--That I\r\n",
      "wonât, then!--Billâs to go down--Here, Bill! the master says youâre to\r\n",
      "go down the chimney!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! So Billâs got to come down the chimney, has he?â said Alice to\r\n",
      "herself. âShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnât be in\r\n",
      "Billâs place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\r\n",
      "I THINK I can kick a little!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\r\n",
      "till she heard a little animal (she couldnât guess of what sort it was)\r\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\r\n",
      "saying to herself âThis is Bill,â she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\r\n",
      "see what would happen next.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of âThere goes Bill!â\r\n",
      "then the Rabbitâs voice along--âCatch him, you by the hedge!â then\r\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices--âHold up his head--Brandy\r\n",
      "now--Donât choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\r\n",
      "us all about it!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, [âThatâs Bill,â thought\r\n",
      "Alice,) âWell, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; Iâm better now--but Iâm\r\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me\r\n",
      "like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo you did, old fellow!â said the others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe must burn the house down!â said the Rabbitâs voice; and Alice called\r\n",
      "out as loud as she could, âIf you do. Iâll set Dinah at you!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, âI\r\n",
      "wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, theyâd take the\r\n",
      "roof off.â After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\r\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, âA barrowful will do, to begin with.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA barrowful of WHAT?â thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\r\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\r\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. âIâll put a stop to this,â\r\n",
      "she said to herself, and shouted out, âYouâd better not do that again!â\r\n",
      "which produced another dead silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\r\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\r\n",
      "head. âIf I eat one of these cakes,â she thought, âitâs sure to make\r\n",
      "SOME change in my size; and as it canât possibly make me larger, it must\r\n",
      "make me smaller, I suppose.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\r\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\r\n",
      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\r\n",
      "animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\r\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\r\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\r\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\r\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe first thing Iâve got to do,â said Alice to herself, as she wandered\r\n",
      "about in the wood, âis to grow to my right size again; and the second\r\n",
      "thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\r\n",
      "the best plan.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\r\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\r\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\r\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\r\n",
      "great hurry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\r\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. âPoor little thing!â\r\n",
      "said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\r\n",
      "she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\r\n",
      "hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\r\n",
      "all her coaxing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\r\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\r\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\r\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\r\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\r\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\r\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\r\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\r\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\r\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\r\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\r\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\r\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\r\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\r\n",
      "till the puppyâs bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!â said Alice, as she leant\r\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\r\n",

      "of the edge with each hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd now which is which?â she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\r\n",

      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\r\n",

      "just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\r\n",
      "to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\r\n",
      "of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\r\n",

      "âWell, be off, then!â said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\r\n",
      "down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as\r\n",
      "she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\r\n",
      "every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she\r\n",
      "remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\r\n",
      "she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âNot at first, perhaps,â said the Hatter: âbut you could keep it to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âGet to your places!â shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\r\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\r\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\r\n",
      "began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\r\n",
      "her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,\r\n",
      "the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\r\n",

      "its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a\r\n",
      "blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,\r\n",
      "with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\r\n",
      "laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin\r\n",
      "again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\r\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was\r\n",
      "generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\r\n",
      "hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up\r\n",
      "and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\r\n",
      "conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\r\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\r\n",
      "time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\r\n",
      "shouting âOff with his head!â or âOff with her head!â about once in a\r\n",
      "minute.\r\n",

      "âand then,â thought she, âwhat would become of me? Theyâre dreadfully\r\n",

      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\r\n",

      "in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\r\n",
      "a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself\r\n",

      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âI donât think they play at all fairly,â Alice began, in rather a\r\n",

      "âHow do you like the Queen?â said the Cat in a low voice.\r\n",

      "on, as she heard the Queenâs voice in the distance, screaming with\r\n",
      "passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\r\n",
      "executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\r\n",
      "of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\r\n",

      "fancy, that: he hasnât got no sorrow, you know. Come on!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\r\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\r\n",
